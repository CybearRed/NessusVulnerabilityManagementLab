<h1>NESSUS: VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT LAB</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I walk through the process of utilizing Nessus Essentials to set up vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation, both of which are fundamental steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. Nessus will be used
to scan local VMs (Windows 10) hosted on the VMware Workstation in order to run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate the exposed vulnerabilities, and rescan to confirm remediation.
