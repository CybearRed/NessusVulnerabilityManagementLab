<h1>NESSUS: VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT LAB</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I walk through the process of utilizing Nessus Essentials to set up vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation, both of which are fundamental steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. Nessus will be used
to scan local VMs (Windows 10) hosted on the VMware Workstation in order to run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate the exposed vulnerabilities, and rescan to confirm remediation.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b> 
- <b>VMware Workstation</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Pre-Setup</h2>

<b>Step 1: Download the Windows 10 ISO file (Download it to a folder you'll remember it's in)</b>

<b>Step 2: Download and install VMware Workstation</b>

<b>Step 3: Download Nessus (It'll ask you to fill out some information and then send you an email with an activation key and download button. You'll see a list of products, just select the 'Nessus' stand alone name one. You'll see at the top 
   that it asks you for an activation code. We already received one via email so you don't need another. The list below should show you the version of Nessus for Windows 10, that's the one we want to download. Once Nessus is downloaded
   it should open the window to install, accept the terms and continue through the installation to begin installing it. Once it's finished it should open in a browser tab on a landing page with "Nessus" and a button to 'Connect via
   SSL.' *MAKE SURE TO SAVE THE URL, WE WILL NEED IT FOR A LATER USE* Select the button to 'Connect via SSL' > Select Advanced > select 'Proceed to localhost.' Once Nessus installs, you'll want to select Nessus Essentials > Skip
   this section (It's asking you to fill out info for an activation code, HOWEVER there was one that should have already been emailed to you. That's the one we will use.) > Input the activation code that was emailed and select 
   continue > Set up a username and password (Something that you won't forget)</b>

   <b>Step 4: Configure VMware Workstation with Windows 10 - While Nessus finishes, we can can configure the settings for our Windows 10 client in the VM. Create a new VM inside the VMware Workstation > Player drop down menu > File > Select Create New Virtual Machine. For the installer
  you'll want to select browse, and browse to the Windows 10 ISO file that was downloaded. Typically you'd want to name the machine something appropriate. For our purposes I'm naming it "Nessus Vulnerability Management" for the 
  name of our lab. Select Next > Maximum Disk size set to 50GB (This is is fine, we're not storing or saving anything to it) > Next > Customize Hardware > Memory (4096GB - You don't want to exceed over half the amount of RAM you have
  as rule of thumb) CPUs (Should be fine as is, again don't utilize over half) Network Adapter (Set it to NAT if you're on a wireless connection. Bridge is used for WIRED connections in the VM) > Once settings are configured you can
  select to power the VM on after finish. 
</b>

<b>Step 5: Complete Installation of Windows 10 Client - The VM should open up and prompt you to begin the process of installing Windows 10 on the VM. Just move through the installation like normal. I don't have a product key > Windows 10 Pro > Accept > Custom Install > Select the only
  hard drive in the options menu > Once complete, select United States for location > Skip until you get to "How would you like to set up?" You want to set up for personal use > Offline account > Limited Experience > name it
  as Admin for our purposes > create an easy memorable password (This is a lab setting so it's fine to use something simple, and we're going to use it later for credentialed scans) > Confirm password > say no to all the selections
  that pop up next > select "Not Now' for Cortana > Windows 10 Installation should be complete now. </b>
